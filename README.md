### Description
A console-based implementation of the classic Hangman game. In this project, a player is prompted to guess letters of a randomly selected word from a predefined list. The goal of this project was to hone Python programming skills, particularly emphasizing object-oriented programming and user interaction.

What it does:
The game prompts the user for letter inputs and displays the current status of the guessed word, replacing underscores with correctly guessed letters. The game ends when the player either correctly guesses the entire word or runs out of lives.

Aim of the project:
To create a fun, interactive game that also serves as a demonstration of Python's capabilities in terms of logic and user interaction.

What I learned:

Object-Oriented Programming in Python
Handling user input and validation
String manipulation and control structures

### Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Faz1990/hangman.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd hangman

### Usage
In the terminal, run the game using:

python hangman.py
Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game.
