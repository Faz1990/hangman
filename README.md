# Hangman
# Contents
# Project Discription
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## What I Have Learned:
How to import random and use it's choice function to allow the computer to choose random words from a list. 
I have created two functions, one that asks the user for a valid one letter input, and one that provides feeback to the user.
